### Firmware Installation Completion Steps

Once the firmware installation process is complete, the Xtouch screen will reboot and proceed through the following steps:

- The device will display the boot screen as it initializes.
- **Ensure you have a formatted SD card inserted.**  
  If no SD card is detected, an error message will prompt you to insert one and retry.
