### Installation Process

1. On the web page, click the **Install Now** button , them click **Begin Installation** to establish a connection between your computer and the Xtouch screen.
2. From the list of available ports displayed, select the serial port assigned to your Xtouch screen.

:::tip[How to identify the correct port]

If you're unsure which port to select, unplug your Xtouch screen and observe which port disappears from the list. Then, plug the screen back in, and the reappearing port is the correct one.  
This is especially helpful if you have multiple devices connected, such as screens used for hardware monitoring or other peripherals.
