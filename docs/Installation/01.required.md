# Required Tools and Preparation

Before beginning, ensure you have the following:

1. **Computer with Google Chrome Installed**

   - A laptop or desktop computer with Google Chrome installed is necessary for this process.  
     Download Chrome from [https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/) if you don’t already have it.

2. **USB Cable**

   - A USB cable compatible with your xtouch screen for connecting it to your computer.

3. **Formatted FAT32 SD Card (≤ 32GB Recommended)**

   - A microSD card with a capacity of **32GB or less**, formatted with the FAT32 file system.
   - This is required for transferring the provisioning file during the first-time setup. Use a reliable SD card and ensure it is properly formatted to avoid issues.

4. **Install Drivers**  
   If your computer does not recognize the xtouch screen, you may need to install the required CH340 drivers:
