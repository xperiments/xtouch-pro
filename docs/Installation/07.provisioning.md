# Provisioning

To manage the xtouch screen, you will need to provision it for both first-time setup and ongoing token updates every three months. **For the Chrome extension to work, users MUST be logged into [bambulab.com](https://www.bambulab.com) or [bambulab.cn](https://www.bambulab.cn) using their account.**

### First-Time Provisioning

When you first open the Chrome extension, follow these steps:

1. **Fill in the Required Information**

   - The extension will prompt you to enter the following details:
     - **SSID**: Your Wi-Fi network name.
     - **SSID Password**: Your Wi-Fi password.
     - **IP**: This is pre-configured as `0.0.0.0` by default, which is correct for the first-time provisioning. Do not change this.

2. **Provision the xtouch Screen**

   - After filling in the SSID and password, click the **"Download provisioning file"** button.

3. **Save and Copy the Provisioning File**

   - Save the downloaded `provisioning.json` file and copy it to the root directory of your SD card.
   - Insert the SD card into the xtouch screen and reboot it.

4. **Verify Connection**
   - Upon reboot, if everything is set up correctly, the xtouch screen will connect to your Wi-Fi network and BambuLab servers.

### Token Renewal (Other Provisioning)

Every three months, when the BambuLab token expires, the xtouch screen will clear its token data. You’ll see a message displayed on the screen with the following instructions:  
**"Provision at xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"**  
This indicates the screen needs to be reprovisioned.

#### Steps for Reprovisioning:

1. **Login to BambuLab**

   - Open [bambulab.com](https://www.bambulab.com) or [bambulab.cn](https://www.bambulab.cn) and log in to your account if you’re not already logged in.

2. **Open the Chrome Extension**

   - Launch the Chrome extension.

3. **Enter the Screen’s IP Address**

   - Enter the IP address displayed on the xtouch screen into the **IP** field of the extension.

4. **Provision the xtouch Screen**

   - Click the **"Provision xtouch"** button.
   - The extension will send the required tokens to the xtouch screen.

5. **Automatic Reboot**
   - Within seconds, the xtouch screen will reboot automatically to apply the new configuration.
