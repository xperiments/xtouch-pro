### First-Time Provisioning

When you first open the Chrome extension, follow these steps:

1. **Fill in the Required Information**

   - The extension will prompt you to enter the following details:

     - **SSID**: Your Wi-Fi network name.
     - **SSID Password**: Your Wi-Fi password.

2. **Generate First Config**

   - After filling in the SSID and password, click the **"Download config.json file"** button.

3. **Save and Copy the Config File**

   - Save the downloaded `config.json` file and copy it to the root directory of your SD card.
   - Insert the SD card into the xtouch screen and reboot it.

4. **Verify Connection**
   - Upon reboot, if everything is set up correctly, the xtouch screen will connect to your Wi-Fi network and BambuLab servers.

### Token Renewal (Other Provisioning)

Every three months, when the BambuLab token expires, the xtouch screen will clear its token data.

This indicates the screen needs to be reprovisioned.

#### Steps for Reprovisioning:

1. **Login to BambuLab**

   - Open [bambulab.com](https://www.bambulab.com) or [bambulab.cn](https://www.bambulab.cn) and log in to your account if you’re not already logged in.

2. **Open the Chrome Extension**

   - Launch the Chrome extension.

3. **Provision the xtouch Screen**

   - Click the **"Provision ==> xtouch-xxxxxxx"** button.
   - The extension will send the required tokens to the xtouch screen.

4. **Enter the Screen’s IP Address** (if point 3 fails)

   - Enter the IP address displayed on the xtouch screen settings into the **IP** field of the extension.

5. **Automatic Reboot**
   - Within seconds, the xtouch screen will reboot automatically to apply the new configuration.
