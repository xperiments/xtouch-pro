# Important Notice

### Xtouch Operating Modes and Best Practices

1. **BBL Lan Mode (LAN Only DEV Mode)**

   - In LAN-only mode, the Xtouch operates independently of cloud services when connected to a BambuLab printer. All essential printer functions, including control and monitoring, are fully accessible without a cloud account.

2. **Firmware Updates**

   - Always verify the firmware compatibility of your printer with the Xtouch by referring to the compatibility list on the product page. Installing unsupported firmware may result in limited functionality, which is not covered under the product warranty.

3. **Power Preferences**
   - For stable operation during frequent printer usage, connect the Xtouch to a 5V DC power source. This minimizes wear on the internal battery and enhances reliability.
   - To switch to battery operation, use the toggle on the back of the Xtouch, providing portable functionality when needed.
