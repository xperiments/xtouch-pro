:::warning[Movement Behavior]
If a movement is attempted and the printer has **not been homed**, the system will **blink the "Home All" button** to indicate that homing is required before proceeding.  
For printers that **do not require homing**, the system will allow movements to proceed without any additional actions. The behavior will adjust accordingly based on the printer's requirements.
